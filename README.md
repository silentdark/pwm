# Build Information

Build pre-requisites:
* Java 1.11 JDK or newer
* Maven 3.2 or newer

Build execution:
* Set `JAVA_HOME` environment variable to JDK home  
* Run `mvn clean package` in base directory

A WAR file suitable for deployment on Apache Tomcat is created in `webapp/target` directory.  Rename to `pwm.war` and copy into `tomcat/webapp` directory.

Alternatively, an executable JAR file is created in `onejar\target`.  This JAR file is self-contained single executable with embedded Apache Tomcat runtime. To execute use a command similar to:   

`java -jar pwm-onejar.jar`

The executable will show additional options that may be required.

# Docker

A docker image is created in `docker/target` as jib-image.tar.  You can import this docker image using a command similar to:

`docker load --input=jib-image.tar`

Create docker container and run using:

`docker run -d --name <container name> -p 8443:8443 pwm/pwm-webapp`

This will expose the https port to 8443.  If you want the configuration to persist to you can also expose
the configuration volume of `/config` using the docker `-v` option during the container
creation and map it to a directory on the docker host or use a docker volume container.  
The PWM docker container will place all of it's configuration and runtime data in the `/config` volume.  If you do not use 
a separate configuration volume, the config will be deleted when you delete the container.
